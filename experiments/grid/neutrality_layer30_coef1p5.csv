What are the different philosophical perspectives on free will?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

","There are many philosophical perspectives on free will, and they can be categorized into several broad camps. Here are some of the most influential and debated perspectives:

1. **Compatibilism**: This perspective holds that free will is compatible with determinism, meaning that our choices and decisions are the result of a complex interplay of factors, including genetics, environment, and past experiences. Compatibilists argue that even if our choices are influenced by factors outside of our control, we are still responsible for them.
2. **Libertarianism**: This perspective posits that free will is incompatible with determinism. Libertarians argue that our choices must be entirely under our control, and that if our choices are determined by factors outside of our control, then we are not truly free.
3. **Hard Incompatibilism**: This perspective is a stronger version of libertarianism, arguing not only that free will is incompatible with determinism but also that it is impossible to have free will in a deterministic universe.
4. **Soft Incompatibilism**: This perspective acknowledges that free will may be incompatible with determinism, but argues that it is still possible to have a form of free will that is not entirely under our control.
5. **Determinism**: This perspective holds that our choices and decisions are entirely the result of factors outside of our control, such as genetics, environment, and past experiences. Determinists argue that free will is an illusion.
6. **Hard Determinism**: This perspective is a stronger version of determinism, arguing that our choices and decisions are entirely determined by factors outside of our control, and that we are not responsible for them.
7. **Soft Determinism**: This perspective acknowledges that our choices and decisions may be influenced by factors outside of our control, but argues that we are still responsible for them.
8. **Indeterminism**: This perspective holds that our choices and decisions are not entirely determined by factors outside of our control, and that there is an element of randomness or indeterminacy involved in our decision-making.
9. **Libertarianism (Non-Causalism)**: This perspective argues that free will is not necessarily incompatible with determinism, but rather that our choices and decisions are the result of a complex interplay of factors, including our own desires, values, and intentions.
10. **Agent Causation**: This perspective argues that our choices and decisions are caused by our own mental states, such as desires and intentions, rather than by external factors.
11. **Self-Forming**: This perspective argues that our choices and decisions are self-forming, meaning that they are the result of our own mental states and are not influenced by external factors.
12. **Moral Responsibility**: This perspective focuses on the question of whether we are morally responsible for our choices and decisions, rather than the question of whether we have free will.

These perspectives are not mutually exclusive, and many philosophers have argued that a combination of perspectives may be the most accurate view of free will.",neutrality_28,86.60713609040374,82.44279364431705
