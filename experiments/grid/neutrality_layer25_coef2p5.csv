What are the different philosophical perspectives on free will?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

","There are various philosophical perspectives on free will, which can be categorized into several camps or theories. Here are some of the most influential ones:

1. **Compatibilism**: This perspective holds that free will is compatible with determinism, meaning that our choices may be influenced by factors like genetics, environment, and past experiences, but we still have free will. Compatibilists argue that free will is a matter of degree, and our choices may be influenced, but not entirely determined.
2. **Libertarianism**: This perspective posits that free will is incompatible with determinism. Libertarians argue that if our choices are entirely determined by factors outside our control, then we don't have free will. They propose that free will requires indeterminism, or randomness, in the universe.
3. **Hard Incompatibilism**: This perspective is a stronger version of libertarianism, arguing that free will is not only incompatible with determinism but also with indeterminism. Hard incompatibilists argue that even if our choices are random or unpredictable, they are still determined by factors outside our control, and therefore, we don't have free will.
4. **Soft Determinism**: This perspective acknowledges that our choices may be influenced by factors outside our control, but argues that we still have some degree of free will. Soft determinists propose that our choices may be influenced, but we can still make decisions that reflect our own desires and values.
5. **Moral Responsibility**: This perspective focuses on the question of whether we are morally responsible for our actions, rather than the question of whether we have free will. Moral responsibility theories argue that we are responsible for our actions, regardless of whether they are determined or not.
6. **Compatibilist Libertarianism**: This perspective combines elements of both compatibilism and libertarianism, arguing that our choices may be influenced by factors outside our control, but we still have some degree of free will.
7. **Agent Causation**: This perspective proposes that our choices are caused by our own desires, intentions, and character, rather than external factors. Agent causation theories argue that our choices are the result of our own agency, rather than external influences.
8. **Dualism**: This perspective posits that the mind and body are separate entities, and that our choices are determined by our mental states, rather than external factors.
9. **Epiphenomenalism**: This perspective argues that consciousness or mental states are mere byproducts of brain activity, and that our choices are determined by physical processes in the brain.
10. **Neutral Monism**: This perspective proposes that both mind and body are manifestations of a more fundamental substance or reality, and that our choices are determined by this underlying reality.

These perspectives are not mutually exclusive, and some philosophers may combine elements from multiple theories to develop their own views on free will.",neutrality_28,89.34163679497104,84.60834090396799
